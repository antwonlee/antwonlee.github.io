#### <a href="https://thriveministry.org" target="_blank">Thrive Ministry</a>

**Role:** Software Developer, DevOps

**Challenges:** We needed a system that integrates between multiple departments
within the organization. The system was fragmented causing
duplication of data in financial and development records. The system was
expensive because it was creating more workflow for the team.  We also needed
something that is User friendly with better UI/UX designs.  The legacy system
was ugly and too complicated for what it was.

**My Contribution:** I built the Rails application that integrates and automates
with Salesforce backend. Designed the UI/UX as well as the backend,
while implementing different third party services through APIs.

I designed the system where business logic happens in Salesforce, while data syncs
between Postgres and Salesforce through Heroku Connect and Salesforce REST API.
Rails is used for customer facing app, while Salesforce provides the backend
automations, lead pipeline, business logic, reports and data visualization.
