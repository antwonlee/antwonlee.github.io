Ruby, Python, and Elixir are fun languages to learn.  One of the first thing I usually learn when I am learning a new language is to print out the values to the console.

In Ruby, we use `puts` to print to console.  Something like: `puts "Hello Kitty."`

In Elixir, we use `IO.puts` to print to console.  Something like: `IO.puts "Hello Kitty."`
