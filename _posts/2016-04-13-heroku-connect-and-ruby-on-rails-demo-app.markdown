At my job, I mainly develop applications with Salesforce and Ruby on Rails.

In this video, I am going to show you a Rails demo app that I've built using Heroku Connect.

Rails is great for customer facing application, while Salesforce is great for managing data, creating reports and workflows in the backend.  Salesforce also provides great drag and drop functionalities that make marketing automations easy.

If you ever built an application that has to manage data from two different systems, you probably know that bidirectional data sync can be a major headache.

This is where <a href="https://www.heroku.com/connect" target="_blank">Heroku Connect</a> shines as a service, it makes bidirectional data synchronization so easy between any Heroku application and Salesforce.

If your app needs to work with Salesforce, I highly recommend trying them out.
