One of the things I am learning this semester in AI for Robotics is Kalman
Filter.  To understand the mathematics better, I coded both in Python and Ruby.

Here are the examples of calculating Maximize Gaussian:

I could see why after coding in both Python and Ruby, the academic institutions prefer the
Python syntax.  It just reads better when you do math.  I am glad Ruby has
keyword arguments now too, similar to Python.
