Teaching is the best way for me to learn something.  I wanted to get better at Machine Learning so I decided to submit a talk to a local <a href="https://www.meetup.com/RubyFTW-Fort-Worth-Ruby-User-Group/events/243499897/" target="_blank">Ruby meetup</a> here in Fort Worth, Texas.

Machine Learning requires you to have a decent knowledge of <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra" target="_blank">Linear Algebra</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability" target="_blank">Statistics and Probability</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus" target="_blank">Multivariate Calculus</a>, Algorithms and Complex Optimizations, and some basic programming.  I am still going through these math subjects with Khan Academy.  It's dense, challenging, and confusing to say the least...  but it's also very rewarding and fun at times.

While it is challenging to describe what Machine Learning is, I started a google slide to visualize what I am thinking through...

I am excited to share what I've learned in my graduate school to Ruby community.  My slides are working in progress, but I thought I would share it here.  Wish me luck!
