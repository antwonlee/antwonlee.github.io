<p>According to the book, here are some indications where your class might be little too large than it ought to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You canâ€™t easily describe what the class does in one sentence.</li>
  <li>You canâ€™t tell what the class does without scrolling.</li>
  <li>The class needs to change for more than one reason.</li>
  <li>The class has more than seven methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should look at one of your large class, and see if any of these attributes are true.</p>
