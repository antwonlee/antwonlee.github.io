I"3<p>What makes a good engineer?  So many of us want to be better at something,
because we want to be valuable and be part of something that matters to us. We
sharpen our skills to stand out, to be that hero.</p>

<p>As for becoming a great software engineer, I came to a conclusion that it is not about knowing everything. Actually, it is impossible to know everything.  This realization brought so much freedom to my life.</p>

<p>What makes me so excited about coding is that there is always something to
learn.  With that, I am okay that I don’t know all the frameworks or languages
out there.  I am okay that I don’t know all the popular libraries other
there. I am okay that we all start as a newbie with many things in life at some
point. I am okay that I am not the best.</p>

<p>What matters to me is that, there is so much to learn—and that makes me
passionate about being an engineer.  There is so much to learn from others and
to teach others what you have learned.  We are always newbies at something, and
that makes this field so exciting.</p>
