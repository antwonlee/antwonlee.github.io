<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is my personal playbook to become a better developer each day.  My focuses are working with Ruby on Rails, Salesforce, Swift, and ReactJS development.  These are technologies I enjoy using and learning everyday.

### My philosophy of being a good developer (Mission Statement):
Be humble yet confident. Learn new things each day to improve the world one code
at a time.

The editor you choose for your workflow speaks a lot about your dedication to
your craft, in our case that is developing software.  Text editor is my
essential tool, and my favorite is Vim.  I was inspired by developers from
<a href="https://thoughtbot.com/" target="_blank">Thoughtbot</a> years ago when I saw how fast it can improve your Rails development.

<h2 id="test-driven-development" style="padding-top: 30px;">Test Driven Development</h2>

I learned majority of my Test Drivent Development for Ruby on Rails from <a href="https://thoughtbot.com" target="_blank">Thoughtbot</a>'s resources: <a href="https://upcase.com" target="_blank">Upcase</a> program and <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/testing-rails?utm_source=giant-robots&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=announcement" target="_blank">Testing Rails</a> book.

My philosophy of writing tests are to be confident of your code, and to make it simple and easy to understand.


### Simple Feature Spec

Here is a simple feature spec where user creates student record in live
production application.

<h2 id="challenges-and-how-i-solved-them" style="padding-top: 30px;">Challenges and How I solved them</h2>

**Challenge:** Non profit organization applications have different payment process compare to traditional product
pricing models. While SaaS services default to tier based pricing model, non
profit organizations often don't want fixed recurring options from their donors. They want both.  They often want to give User an option to input their own desired amount to their recurring donation.  My challenge was to build a payment system that does just that.
