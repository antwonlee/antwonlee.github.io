This is my personal playbook to become a better developer each day.  Currently, my focuses are working with Ruby on Rails, ReactJS, Swift, and Salesforce development.  These are technologies I enjoy using and want to learn more.  

My philosophy of being a good developer is always to be humble and learn new things to improve the world.  Thanks for visiting. :sunglasses:

##Test Driven Development

I learned majority of my Test Drivent Development for Ruby on Rails from <a href="https://thoughtbot.com" target="_blank">Thoughtbot</a> and their best practices, <a href="https://upcase.com" target="_blank">Upcase</a> program and <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/testing-rails?utm_source=giant-robots&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=announcement" target="_blank">Testing Rails</a> book.

My philosophy of writing tests are to be confident of your code, and to make it simple and easy to understand.
