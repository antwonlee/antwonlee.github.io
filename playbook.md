<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is my personal playbook to become a better developer each day.  Currently, my focuses are working with Ruby on Rails, Salesforce, Swift, and ReactJS development.  These are technologies I enjoy using and want to learn.

### My philosophy of being a good developer (Mission Statement):
Be humble yet confident. Learn new things each day to improve the world one code
at a time.

The editor you choose for your workflow speaks a lot about your dedication to
your craft, in our case that is developing software.

I learned majority of my Test Drivent Development for Ruby on Rails from <a href="https://thoughtbot.com" target="_blank">Thoughtbot</a>'s resources: <a href="https://upcase.com" target="_blank">Upcase</a> program and <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/testing-rails?utm_source=giant-robots&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=announcement" target="_blank">Testing Rails</a> book.

My philosophy of writing tests are to be confident of your code, and to make it simple and easy to understand.
